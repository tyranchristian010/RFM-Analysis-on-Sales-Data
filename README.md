# RFM-Analysis-on-Sales-Data
To generate insights into the past purchasing behavior of customers, a RFM analysis was performed on a retail dataset. Utilized SQL subqueries, CTEs, aggregates, and window functions to create a customer segmentation analysis. The results were then visualized in Tableau. Customer frequency and monetary value, as well as recency affect customer lifetime value, a measure of engagement.
